Given the events in the world over the past few months and the uncertainty that will follow, we have decided to postpone our 2020 event to 2021.

We have not come to this decision easily. We are doing this in the spirit of maintaining the safety of all of our attendees, our staff, and the staff of our venue at the National Museum of American Jewish History.

We will be announcing the dates for our next event to be held in 2021 soon.

Anyone who has purchased a ticket for 2020 will receive a full refund, or be allowed to carry over to 2021.

In the meantime, we would love to see you at our Philly JS Dev virtual meetups! We will resume these online later in the year. If you are interested, [please join the meetup](http://meetu.ps/c/Y4nH/C4mXf/f), so you can be notified of how and when to access our upcoming meetups. We hope to see you there.

Be safe. Take care of the people around you. Letâ€™s look out for each other.
