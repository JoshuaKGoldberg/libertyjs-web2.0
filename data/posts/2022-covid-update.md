Since our last conference in 2019, we've been meeting monthly trying to figure out when the next LibertyJS could be. As a team, we've been to numerous virtual conferences to see if that could be our path forward to see you all again soon. But alas, virtual doesn't have the same excitement, engagement, and networking as in person does. 

We want to throw the best conference for our community and have decided to wait this never-ending pandemic out. We are hoping to see you again late 2022 or early 2023. Your health and safety plus the spirit of an in-person experience is the upmost important to us. We can't wait to hear all about your new challenges, new tech stacks, and successes over the last few years. 

If you are interested in sponsoring the next LibertyJS or want to volunteer your time to help us put on the best event please reach out to [info@libertyjs.com](mailto:nfo@libertyjs.com)
