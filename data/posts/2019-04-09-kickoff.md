New year, new venue! The first big announcement is that we have unfortunately outgrown the space at the Science History Institute. We will miss the space and all the wonderful people that we had the opportunity to work with from SHI and hope that we will grow into different types of events that lead us back to them at some point.

This year we'll be moving to the National Museum of American Jewish History located on 5th and Market. We're excited to be working with the team and the new space that should let us grow for another couple of years but are also looking forward to your thoughts on it as well.

Our new website format and hosting will allow us to update the site more frequently to bring you the latest information as it unfolds. We hope to provide you more details on speakers and programming quickly.

This year we're trying to incorporate the feedback that we received last year, specifically around more diversity. We value all of our attendees and are working to ensure we provide the best programming we can.

If you're interested in speaking this year, please fill out our CFP at: [https://www.papercall.io/libertyjs-2019](https://www.papercall.io/libertyjs-2019)


Thank you,

The LibertyJS Organizing Committee
