We will go over all of these together. I'll start with a basic React app using a few stateful, class components using life-cycle methods, custom methods and API interaction. I will then convert the components over to functional ones while integrating several different hooks, without losing any functionality. Finally, we will look into some common \"gotchas\" that may be confusing for people starting out with hooks. You will come away from this talk with a good foundation for various primitive hooks in React, and you'll understand how they're used and how you can start to write your own custom hooks.",

For websites in particular, deploying code is often done behind the scenes without a user having to install an update since each new connection can be fulfilled with the latest version of the site. Having complete control of this process allows us to be creative in how fast or slow we deploy code in order to optimize for either maintainability of the code base, getting features out fast, or even both. While deployments seemingly look like a trivial final step, how we deploy code has far flung effects on how we write code. We will examine how each deployment strategy affects how developers produce code so that we can make an informed decision on the tradeoffs.",
