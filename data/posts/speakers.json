Are you a Vue.js developer who wants to learn how to use ReactJS, or the other way around? Trust us, you can learn from each other, and that’s exactly what you will do on this session. We will give you a buggy application that you’ll have to fix before adding new features to it using either Vue.js or React. How fast will you go? Will you share your findings with other developers? You’re welcome to test this during our workshop. We have built the same application with ReactJS and Vue.js. We invite you to spend the session learning how to build such an app yourself with the help of our mentors. By the end of the session, you should be able to answer these questions: • What is Functional Reactive Programming? • How to use React and Vue.js? What are the main differences between Vue.js and React?",

How do we know if we’re doing ‘mentoring’ right, and what small things do we not know about that could be doing more harm than good? Through my work as over the past 3 years directing mentors at a monthly coding class, I’ve been able to compile effective methods through research and experience that will help all developers be better mentors, whether within an established mentor/mentee relationship or just in quick day-to-day teaching opportunities. By setting expectations, learning how to be more friendly and accessible, removing roadblocks, practicing self-care, developing empathy for mentees, and constantly iterating based on actionable feedback, we can all contribute to creating richer tech communities that thrive on constant improvement and collective growth.",

Necessities that makes you distinct, skills that make you stand out. The diversities that make us rare and unique if it’s your ethnic background, race, ethnic customs, religious beliefs, sex, sexuality, or form of individuality may also be a cause of contention. Discover how to bring out that, which is already within you and communicate, work with individuals who are diverse as well as, striking-up great conversation between one another. Also, this presentation will contribute to you your attendees with fostering a positive change and cultivate a more inviting place of work. This presentation will discuss the impacts of diversity collectively using identifying what variety can be combined with how it affects a business. The presentation will assist with explaining what it signifies being an inclusive place of work, offer comprehensive measures to assess best what degree one’s place of work fosters inclusion a and diversity. The workshop, through means of role-playing scenarios, present ways you can take to impact positive philosophies at your place of work. Individuals will take with them an increased perception of the implications of a tolerant, inclusive and diverse place of work. Individuals will take with them, along with personal skills, which one will utilize to develop into promoters of social change, that will build a more diverse workplace.",

For websites in particular, deploying code is often done behind the scenes without a user having to install an update since each new connection can be fulfilled with the latest version of the site. Having complete control of this process allows us to be creative in how fast or slow we deploy code in order to optimize for either maintainability of the code base, getting features out fast, or even both. While deployments seemingly look like a trivial final step, how we deploy code has far flung effects on how we write code. We will examine how each deployment strategy affects how developers produce code so that we can make an informed decision on the tradeoffs.",

It sure did seem to be straightforward at first especially with proper test coverage, however 20% -25% into this migration we encountered a certain issues which meant re-evaluation of several architectural decisions that had been made in this regard. The goal of this talk is to give an in-depth analysis of the following - Highlight what we tried - Highlight where we failed and the lessons learned - Changes made related to the architecture - How we finally achieved 100% full migration of one of our most important projects into Vue JS",

Through a live coding demo, we’ll start with basic playback and work our way through audio sprites, live streaming, 3D spatial audio and more.
