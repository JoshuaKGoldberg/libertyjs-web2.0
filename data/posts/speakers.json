Research also tells us that teams are capable of producing solutions that are more creative and of higher quality than those of single individuals.  However, teams, by definition, consist of people--possibly the very ones who are causing our unhappiness.<br><br>This talk explores the science behind human persuasion, examines the roots of motivation, and reveals the single quality that all high-performing teams share.  You’ll leave armed to persuade, primed to understand, and motivated to create teams that inspire everyone to do their best work.",

How do you use them? Why should I use them? Do they replace life-cycle methods. We will go over all of these together. I will start with a basic React app using a few stateful, class components using life-cycle, custom methods, and API interaction. I will convert the components over to functional components and integrating several different hooks, while not losing any functionality.You’ll come away from this talk with a good foundation for most of the primitive hooks in React, and you’ll understand how to use them & write your own custom hooks.",
