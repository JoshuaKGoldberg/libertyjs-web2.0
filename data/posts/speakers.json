Research also tells us that teams are capable of producing solutions that are more creative and of higher quality than those of single individuals.  However, teams, by definition, consist of people--possibly the very ones who are causing our unhappiness.<br><br>This talk explores the science behind human persuasion, examines the roots of motivation, and reveals the single quality that all high-performing teams share.  You’ll leave armed to persuade, primed to understand, and motivated to create teams that inspire everyone to do their best work.",

How do you use them? Why should I use them? Do they replace life-cycle methods. We will go over all of these together. I will start with a basic React app using a few stateful, class components using life-cycle, custom methods, and API interaction. I will convert the components over to functional components and integrating several different hooks, while not losing any functionality.You’ll come away from this talk with a good foundation for most of the primitive hooks in React, and you’ll understand how to use them & write your own custom hooks.",

What if you could use machine learning to help you keep up with all of the changes? While it’s far from taking all of the programming jobs, machine learning can help developers make more user-friendly web applications. With the use of Brain.js, you can do text prediction, make small layout changes, check for malicious users, and more. In this talk, attendees will learn some background on machine learning and algorithms and see examples of where Brain.js can be used in real applications. We’ll cover business cases in web development where machine learning can help, how neural networks work, and how JavaScript can be used to train a model and make real-time updates for users. By the end of the talk, attendees should have a good understanding of basic machine learning concepts and an idea of how they could get started with Brain.js.",

We’ll look at how we’re using Web Components to share code between sites and if they can be used to share components between frameworks. I’ll go over how we’re sharing data between codebases with Redux. Lastly we’ll talk about Shared Flows; pulling out complicated reusable logic into its own microsite.

Are you a Vue.js developer who wants to learn how to use ReactJS, or the other way around? Trust us, you can learn from each other, and that’s exactly what you will do on this session. We will give you a buggy application that you’ll have to fix before adding new features to it using either Vue.js or React. How fast will you go? Will you share your findings with other developers? You’re welcome to test this during our workshop. We have built the same application with ReactJS and Vue.js. We invite you to spend the session learning how to build such an app yourself with the help of our mentors.

Through my work as over the past 3 years directing mentors at a monthly coding class, I’ve been able to compile effective methods through research and experience that will help all developers be better mentors, whether within an established mentor/mentee relationship or just in quick day-to-day teaching opportunities. By setting expectations, learning how to be more friendly and accessible, removing roadblocks, practicing self-care, developing empathy for mentees, and constantly iterating based on actionable feedback, we can all contribute to creating richer tech communities that thrive on constant improvement and collective growth.",

Discover how to bring out that, which is already within you and communicate, work with individuals who are diverse as well as, striking-up great conversation between one another. Also, this presentation will contribute to you your attendees with fostering a positive change and cultivate a more inviting place of work. This presentation will discuss the impacts of diversity collectively using identifying what variety can be combined with how it affects a business. The presentation will assist with explaining what it signifies being an inclusive place of work, offer comprehensive measures to assess best what degree one’s place of work fosters inclusion a and diversity. The workshop, through means of role-playing scenarios, present ways you can take to impact positive philosophies at your place of work. Individuals will take with them an increased perception of the implications of a tolerant, inclusive and diverse place of work.

For websites in particular, deploying code is often done behind the scenes without a user having to install an update since each new connection can be fulfilled with the latest version of the site. Having complete control of this process allows us to be creative in how fast or slow we deploy code in order to optimize for either maintainability of the code base, getting features out fast, or even both. While deployments seemingly look like a trivial final step, how we deploy code has far flung effects on how we write code. We will examine how each deployment strategy affects how developers produce code so that we can make an informed decision on the tradeoffs.",
