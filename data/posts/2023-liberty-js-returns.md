We are happy to announce that we have secured dates with our venue for October 12th and 13th of 2023. We welcome you back to the National Museum of American Jewish History where we will be holding our first event since lockdown in person!

Your health and safety plus the spirit of an in-person experience is of the utmost importance to us. We can't wait to hear all about your new challenges, new tech stacks, and successes over the last few years.

We are now accepting Speaker candidates through papercall. [Click here to submit](https://www.papercall.io/libertyjs-2023)

If you are interested in sponsoring the next LibertyJS to help us put on the best event yet, please reach out to [info@libertyjs.com](mailto:info@libertyjs.com). As we did in 2020, we will offer all sponsors a full refund should the event date change.
