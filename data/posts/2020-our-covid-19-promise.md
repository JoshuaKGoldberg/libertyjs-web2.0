As conference organizers, we want to express that the health of our attendees, volunteers, speakers, and sponsors is of the utmost importance.

We continue to closely monitor the global situation and we will adjust as needed. Our final decision will be made September 17th as to whether we will need to postpone or cancel the event. If you purchase a ticket, you will be issued a notice at that time with multiple options including a full refund.

Key points:
* Your ticket is valid for a change in date due to COVID-19, a refund, or for the 2021 conference
* You should wait to book hotel and flight until you are comfortable with travel
* We miss you and can't wait to see our community back together
